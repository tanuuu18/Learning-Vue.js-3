# Binding Classes


## There are 2 ways fot binding the classes:
<ol>
  <li>Static class: Static class are the ones who will never change and will always be present on the HTML element.</li>


 But, in a web app you might want to manipulate an element's list of classes.
 
 In other words, you need Dynamic classes which allows you to add or remove classes when things change in your application.
<li>Dynamic class: Dynamic classes are similar to static classes. But, we have to use then <b>v-bind</b> directives in order to bind a javascript expression to our class.</li>

</ol>
